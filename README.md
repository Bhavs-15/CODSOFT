# CODSOFT
Welcome to my Data Science Internship Portfolio! In this repository, one can find some projects that I have completed during my internship at Codsoft. These projects showcase my skills in data analysis, machine learning, and problem-solving. The description of each project is given below:


**PROJECT**

1.Titanic Survival Detection: The main focus of this project is on analyzing the Titanic dataset for predicting passenger survival. It involves data preprocessing, data analysis, and building a machine learning model to predict survival.

2.Movie Rating Prediction: In this project, a movie rating prediction system using Python is built. The project involves data collection, preprocessing, and the development of a machine learning model to predict movie ratings.

3.Iris Flower Classification: The Iris Flower Classification project is a classic machine learning task. This involves using the Iris dataset for classifying iris flowers into various species based on the measurements of their sepals and petals.
